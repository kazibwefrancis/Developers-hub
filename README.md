# Flutter Development Assignment  

## Overview  
This assignment is designed to help interns learn the basics of Flutter development, UI design, data management, and app functionality over a three-week period. The goal is to build a functional task management app with persistent storage.  

## Folder Structure  
The project structure includes multiple Flutter projects, each representing different tasks and concepts covered in the assignment:  

- `basicui` - Basic UI development with login screen.  
- `counterapp` - State management and basic interactivity.  
- `developers-hub` - (Main project repository).  
- `taskapp` - Final task management app.  
- `Todolistapp` - Persistent storage and task list app.  

## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Install Flutter and Required Tools  
Ensure you have Flutter installed on your system:  
- Download and install Flutter from [Flutter’s official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  
- Install either **Android Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** with the Flutter extension.  
- Ensure you have an emulator or a physical device for testing.  

### 2. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kazibwefrancis/Developers-hub.git
cd Developers-hub
```

### 3. Run the App  
Navigate into the specific project folder (e.g., `basicui`) and run:  
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
This will fetch dependencies and launch the app on the connected device/emulator.
